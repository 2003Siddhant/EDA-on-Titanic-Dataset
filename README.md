# EDA-on-Titanic-Dataset
Here we have performed an exploratory data analysis on Titanic Dataset .This dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographics, cabin class, fare, survival status, etc. In this analysis, we aim to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and understand the factors that may have influenced the survival of passengers.

Insights:
Based on our exploratory data analysis, we gained several insights into the Titanic dataset:

Passengers in higher classes had a higher likelihood of survival compared to those in lower classes.
Women and children had a higher survival rate compared to men.
Passengers traveling with family members had varying survival rates depending on the family size.
There was a correlation between fare and survival, indicating that passengers who paid higher fares might have been prioritized during rescue efforts.
